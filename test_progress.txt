PROGRESS UPDATE - Test Fixes:
=============================
Fixed Tests: 6/14 original failures
- Migration tests fixed: jest.resetModules() + config re-init
- Error handling tests fixed: jest.resetModules() after doMock()

Remaining Failures: 2
- Integration CRUD test getting 'OLD-001' instead of created ticket
- Integration concurrent test getting 'Old Ticket' instead of 'Update 2'

Root Cause: Data from migration tests ('OLD-001', 'Old Ticket') is leaking
into integration tests, suggesting dbInstance or in-memory store not being
fully cleared or the mock responses are wrong.

Next Step: Add explicit dbInstance verification and data isolation
between test groups
