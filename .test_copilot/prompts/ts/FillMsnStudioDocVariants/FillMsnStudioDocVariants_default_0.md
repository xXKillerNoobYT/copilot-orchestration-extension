I Created documentation file for the package "<<<PackageName>>>".

# Task
Please fill the mock data in the variants section.

# Package folder path
<<<PackagePath>>>

# Documentation File Path
<<<TargetFilePath>>>

# Guidelines
- MUST make sure the type of the component props is correct.
- Do not have any TypeScript errors in the doc file.
- Separate the common mock data into a separate file and import them in the doc.
- The variant name must be meaningful and describe the scenario.

# If you need to create a new file for the mock data, please save it to the following path:
`experiences/msn-studio/src/data/`
