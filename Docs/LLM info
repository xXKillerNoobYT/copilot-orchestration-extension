# Want me to turn this into a **Notion‑ready reference page**, a **cross‑linked index**, or a **server‑testing checklist**?
Given your workflow style, I can also generate:

- A **coverage‑checked Notion documentation map**  
- A **server testing suite** (curl + Python + TypeScript)  
- A **local‑server orchestration prompt** for your LM Studio agent system  
- A **model‑info schema** for your local server at `http://192.168.137.52:1234/v1`

Just tell me the format you want.
