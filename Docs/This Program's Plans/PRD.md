## Implementation Notes

**To integrate this PRD with the codebase:**

1. Create a PRD generator script that reads CONSOLIDATED-MASTER-PLAN.md
2. Parse GitHub Issues from repository
3. Merge features and tasks into structured JSON
4. Generate this Markdown file
5. Commit to version control

**Use PRD.json (machine-readable version) for**:
- Agent consumption (Planning, Orchestrator, Coding AI)
- API endpoints that need structured data
- Programmatic verification checks

**Use PRD.md (this file) for**:
- Human-readable reference
- Review and approval workflows
- Tracking documentation
- Communication with stakeholders
